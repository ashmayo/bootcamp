#1: Variables

a = 1 # a now stores the value 1
b = a # b now stores the value of a which is 1  

#2. Run this code:

x = 1 # x stores the value 1
x = x + 1 # x now stores the value 2

# x = 2 because the right side of an assignment statement
# is evaluated first which allows us to use 
# the variable on both sides of the assignment sign
